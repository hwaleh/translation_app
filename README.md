# Translation- App

## General Info
This repository contains project code for a real time text to speech cross- platform mobile app. The goal of this project is to learn full- stack mobile app development in React Native while expanding my knowledge of NLP and LLMs.

## To Do
This project is a work in progress. I plan to flesh out the app UI and create comprehensive tests for the app, in addition to creating user settings and preferences. Furthermore, I will add real time translation for speech based user input. I also plan to release the app so that I can learn CI/ CD practices for mobile apps. Additionally, I will replace the current translation API with a custom tuned LLM. I am using Google Colab for this process. 

## Results
Currently, the app can accept user input text and translate it to any language the [translate- google API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/translate-google-api) supports. The app also supports text to speech functionality for translated text.
